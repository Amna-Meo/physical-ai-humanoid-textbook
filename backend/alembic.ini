[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are requested
# to run after the completion of a migration file.
#
# format is one of:
#
#   key = value
#   key = some.module:some_function
#   key = some.module:some_function with arguments
#
# key is the name of the script/hook. This will be displayed as part of
# the --help output for the "alembic" command.
# value is the name of a system command or a Python function.
#
# for Python functions, the alembic.runtime.environment.EnvironmentContext
# and alembic.operations.Operations objects are passed to the function.
# for system commands, no arguments are passed.
#
# system commands are run in the directory where the "alembic" command
# is run.

# format using the "black" package
# hooks = black
# black.type = exec
# black.executable = black
